### Overview

This course introduces the concepts and some of the packages in the Tidyverse. This will give users the tools needed to speed up their data wrangling and make their code much more comprehensible.

The course consists of 1 section, in which we will cover tidying up data, piping with magrittr, and the packages dplyr and stringr. This is an abridged version of the comprehensive tidyverse course found [here](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_tidyverse/).

Each section is presented as HTML presentations or single page document. Exercises and answer sheets are included to practice techniques and provide future reference examples.

Course material and exercises are available to view as rendered HTML at https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_tidyverse_core/.
