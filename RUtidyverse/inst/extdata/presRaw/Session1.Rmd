## Data wrangling with the Tidyverse

<b>There are some problems we face often when dealing with data.</b>

<ul>
  <li>Every dataset is different. Sometimes very different.</li>
  <li>There are many ways to do things. Everyone has their favorite syntax.</li>
</ul>

<b>The issue:</b>
Many fundamental data processing functions exist in <i>Base R</i> and beyond. Sometimes they can be inconsistent or unnecessarily complex. Especially when dealing with non-standard dataframes. The result is code that is confusing and doesn't flow i.e. nested functions

---
## What does it mean to be tidy?

Tidyverse is most importantly a philosophy for data analysis that more often then not makes wrangling data easier. The tidyverse community have built what they describe as an <i>opinionated</i> group of packages. These packages readily talk to one another. 

<ul>
  <li>More efficient code</li>
  <li>Easier to remember syntax</li>
  <li>Easier to read syntax</li>
</ul>

You can read their <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html">manifesto</a> to get a better understanding of the tidy ethos. 
  
---
## What does it <i>actually</i> mean to be tidy?

<ul>
  <li>A defined vision for coding style in R  
  <li>A defined vision for data formats in R
  <li>A defined vision for package design in R
  <li>Unified set of community pushing in a cohesive direction
  <li>Critical mass of people to influence the way the whole R community evolves
</ul>

---
## What are the main tidy tools?

<ul>
  <li>ggplot2 – making pretty graphs 
  <li>readr – reading data into R  
  <li>dplyr – manipulating data  
  <li>tibble - working with tibbles  
  <li>tidyr – miscellaneous tools for tidying data
  <li>purrr - iterating over data  
  <li>stringr – working with strings  
  <li>forcats - working with factors  
</ul>

Other tools have now been made by the Tidy community. This community also overlaps with Bioconductor. But the packages above are the linchpins that hold it together. 

---
## What we will be doing today

We will touch on the core utilities of most of these packages, and show some of their most useful functions.  


---
## What we won't be doing today

We already covered plotting with [ggplot](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Plotting_In_R/).     



We also will not be going into the purr or forcats packages. For a more extensive look into tidyverse, we have a full day workshop [online](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_tidyverse/).

---
## Lets get tidy!
First step lets load in the data we are using today
```{r}

load(file='data/my_tidy.Rdata')
```

---
## Are all data frames equal?
```{r}
head(df1)
```

```{r}
head(df2)
```

---
## Are all data frames equal?
```{r}
head(df3a)
```

```{r}
head(df3b)
```

---
## What is a tidy dataset?

A tidy dataset is a data frame (or table) for which the following are true:

* Each variable has its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each value has its own cell

***Which of our dataframes is tidy?***
--
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our first dataframe is tidy

---
## Why bother?

Consistent dataframe layouts help to ensure that all values are present and that relationships between data points are clear.

R is a vectorized programming language. R builds data frames from vectors, and R works best when its operation are vectorized.

Tidy data utilizes both these aspects of R.  
=> Precise and Fast

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Reading and Tibbles

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Lets load in the tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



---
## readr: Reading data into R

Lets start from the beginning and tidy some data. First step is to read in data. 

readr:

* read_csv(): comma separated (CSV) files  
* read_tsv(): tab separated files  
* read_delim(): general delimited files  
* read_fwf(): fixed width files  
* read_table(): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space  
* read_log(): web log files   

---
## Reading in with base

When you read data in with base, it goes into a regular dataframe. When you return the dataframe through typing it in the console it will just print the whole dataframe.

```{r}
untidy_counts_base <- read.csv("data/hemato_rnaseq_counts.csv")

untidy_counts_base
```

---
## Reading in with readr

When you use readr to read in your data, you instead get a special dataframe called a tibble. Tibbles have several properties that make them more user friendly i.e. When you return the tibble through typing it in the console it will print a preview, with some information about dimensions and data types. 
```{r}

read_csv("data/hemato_rnaseq_counts.csv")

```

---
## Reading in with readr
Tibbles carry and display extra information. While reading in it is easy to specify data type. 
```{r}
untidy_counts <- read_csv("data/hemato_rnaseq_counts.csv", col_types = cols(
    ENTREZ = col_character(),
    CD34_1 = col_integer(),
    ORTHO_1 = col_integer(),
    CD34_2 = col_integer(),
    ORTHO_2 = col_integer()
  ))
untidy_counts
```

## Subsetting to make tibbles
You can use the same methods as base to interact with tibbles to subset them.

```{r}
untidy_counts[1,]
```
```{r}
untidy_counts[,1]
```

---
## Subsetting to make tibbles
Tibbles are column-oriented, so if you don't specify row/column with a comma, it will assume you want a column. 
```{r}

untidy_counts[1]
```

---
## Subsetting to make vectors
The outputs thus far have produced more tibbles. Sometimes we just want a vector. Like lists, we can use double brackets. 
```{r}
untidy_counts[[1]]
```

---
## Subsetting to make vectors
Also, like lists we can use a dollar sign with the column name.
```{r}
untidy_counts$ENTREZ
```

---
## Tibbles: Converting to tibble
There are coercion functions similar to base to convert a regular dataframe to a tibble. 
```{r}

as_tibble(untidy_counts_base)
```

---
## Tibbles: Converting to tibble
Once it is a tibble it is straight forward to modify the datatype using the dplyr function mutate_at. 
```{r}

untidy_counts_base <- as_tibble(untidy_counts_base)
untidy_counts_base <- mutate_at(untidy_counts_base, vars(ENTREZ), as.character)
untidy_counts_base
```

---
## Tibbles: Converting from tibble

Some tools are not tibble friendly. Calling as.data.frame is sufficient to convert it back to a base data frame

```{r}

as.data.frame(untidy_counts_base) %>% head(n=12)
```

---
## Tibbles: Make your own - (pt1)
We will make our own tibble now from scratch, using some metadata. We are accessing some Bioconductor databases that contain annotation information for genes. 
First we grab the position of genes. Then we use the IDs to get gene symbols. We will cover how to do this in more detail later on [here](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/singlepage/GenomicFeatures_In_Bioconductor.html#Extracting_Genomic_Locations)

```{r}
# Lets load in some packages
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)

hg19_genes <- genes(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)

keys <- hg19_genes$gene_id

symbols <- AnnotationDbi::select(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = keys, columns = c("SYMBOL"), keytype = "ENTREZID")

```


---
## Tibbles: Make your own
Now we will put all the metadata together into a tibble
```{r}

counts_metadata <- tibble(ID = symbols$ENTREZID, SYMBOL = symbols$SYMBOL, LENGTH = lengths(hg19_genes))

counts_metadata
```


---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

  )
}else{
  cat("# Tidying up your data

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Tidying data up

What is wrong with the count dataframe from a tidy viewpoint?  

_Remember_. These are the rules:

* Each variable has its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each value has its own cell

```{r}
untidy_counts
```

---
## Tidying data up

What is wrong with the count dataframe from a tidy viewpoint?  

_Remember_, these are the rules:

* Each variable has its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each value has its own cell

__A single variable with multiple columns__

```{r}
untidy_counts
```

---
## Reshape data with pivot_longer and pivot_wider

When all the content is in the tibble, but it is in the wrong orientation, tidyr has some tools to move the data around quickly and easily:  

__pivot_longer and pivot_wider__

---
## tidyr::pivot_longer
pivot_longer allows you to collapse single variables that are spread over multiple columns. In this case new columns Sample and Counts are created. Sample is made from the column names hence *names_to*. While Counts is made from the values within the columns hence *values_to*. We are also specifying that we are tidying all columns apart from ENTREZ with the cols argument. 

**This recently replaced a function called gather**
```{r}

tidier_counts <- pivot_longer(untidy_counts, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "counts", cols = c(-ENTREZ))
tidier_counts

```

---
## tidyr::pivot_wider
pivot_wider allows you to go in the opposite direction to pivot_longer. We can spread single variables over multiple columns.

**This recently replaced a function called spread**
```{r}
pivot_wider(tidier_counts, names_from = c(Sample), values_from = counts)
```

---
## What is next to tidy?

_Remember_, these are the rules:

* Each variable has its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each value has its own cell

```{r}
tidier_counts
```

---
## What is next to tidy?

_Remember_, these are the rules:

* Each variable has its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each value has its own cell

__Multiple variables in a single column__

```{r}
tidier_counts
```

---
## Splitting and combining varaibles

When there are several variables crammed into a single column, tidyr can be used to split single values into several:  

__separate__

---
## tidyr::separate
Separate allows you to break a strings in a variable by a separator. In this case the cell type and replicate number are broken by underscore.
```{r}
tidy_counts <- separate(tidier_counts, Sample, sep = "_", into=c("CellType", "Rep"), remove=TRUE)
tidy_counts
```

---
## tidyr::unite
Unite can go the other way. This can sometime be useful i.e. if you want a specific sample ID
```{r}
unite(tidy_counts, Sample, CellType, Rep, remove=FALSE)
```


---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Piping with Magrittr

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Piping with Magrittr

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Simplifying code

Often when getting started code can get a little out of control and confusing. As addiotnal steps are adeed code can become nested. For example here we tidy our data in a single complicated expression 

```{r}
tidy_counts <- separate(pivot_longer(untidy_counts, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "counts", cols = c(-ENTREZ)), Sample, sep = "_", into = c("CellType","Rep"), remove=FALSE)
```

We simplified things by saving each step as an intermediate. This is not very efficient. 

```{r}
tidier_counts <- pivot_longer(untidy_counts, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "counts", cols = c(-ENTREZ))
tidy_counts <- separate(tidier_counts, Sample, sep = "_", into = c("CellType","Rep"), remove=FALSE)

```


---
## Piping to string functions together

Piping allows you to pass the result from one expression directly into another.  
magrittR package developed the %>% pipe which is integral to the tidy way of formatting code

The pattern is similar but now follows a specific logical flow:

![dplyr](./imgs/dplyr_pipe2.png)

## Piping to string functions together
This way there are no intermediates and the steps in your data analysis are logical and clear unlike nested code. 
```{r}

tidy_counts <- untidy_counts %>% 
  gather(key=Sample, value=counts, -ENTREZ) %>% 
  separate(Sample, sep = "_", into = c("CellType","Rep"), remove=FALSE)
tidy_counts
```


## Advanced Piping

A period ( . ) can be used as placeholders to represent the object being piped in. 
In this case we use the period to in a logical expression, which we then use to subset itself. 
```{r}

tidier_counts %>% .[.$counts > 0,]

```

%<>% is a modification of the pipe. This is a two way pipe that will carry the variable forward, and once expression is resolved, the result then gets assigned back to the original variable.

````{r}
library(magrittr)
tidier_counts %<>% .[.$counts > 0,]
tidier_counts
```

Keep your eyes out for a base R pipe as it is under development at the moment *|>*

}else{
  cat("# Joining tibbles together

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## Joining
Often you have two dataframes and you want to join them together. Data frames can be joined on a shared variable _a.k.a._ a key. We want this key to be unique i.e. ENTREZ ID. 

---
## dplyr::inner_join - Merging dataframes
```{r}
tidy_counts
```

---
## dplyr::inner_join - Merging dataframes
```{r}
counts_metadata
```

---
## dplyr::inner_join - Merging dataframes
```{r}
tidy_counts_meta <- inner_join(tidy_counts, counts_metadata, by = c("ENTREZ" = "ID"))
```

---
## There are many ways to join things

Inner Join 

* Keeps all observations in x and y with matching keys

Outer Join

* A left join keeps all observations in x and those in y with matching keys.
* A right join keeps all observations in y and those in x with matching keys. 
* A full join keeps all observations in x and y


---
## dplyr::left_join 
My tidy_counts tibble is the on the left, so is the backbone for this join. This will only then show the metadata that has a matching key i.e. ENTREZID. 
```{r}
left_join(tidy_counts, counts_metadata, by = c("ENTREZ" = "ID"))
```

---
## dplyr::right_join
Now the counts_metadata tibble is the backbone for this join. Many of the keys (i.e. ENTREZID) in this tibble do not have matches in the tidy_counts_tibble. Anything without a match is filled in with NA. 
```{r}
tidy_counts_expressed <- right_join(tidy_counts, counts_metadata, by = c("ENTREZ" = "ID"))
tidy_counts_expressed %>% tail()
```

---
## Filtering joins

Filtering joins 

* A semi join only keeps all observations in x that are matched in y. y isn't returned. 
* A anti join only keeps all observations in x that are _not_ matched in y. y isn't returned. 

---
## dplyr::semi_join
Semi join only keeps observations in x that are matched in y. y is only used as a reference and is not in output
```{r}
semi_join(counts_metadata, tidy_counts, by = c("ID" = "ENTREZ") )
```

---
## dplyr::anti_join
Anti join only keeps observations in x that are not matched in y. y is only used as a reference and is not in output
```{r}

anti_join(counts_metadata, tidy_counts, by = c("ID" = "ENTREZ") )

```

  )
}else{
  cat("# Quickly manipulate data with dplyr
---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## dplyr
This package contains a variety of tools to access and manipulate dataframes.  

They have a common rationale:

![dplyr](./imgs/dplyr.png)

---
## dplyr::select
**select** allows you to work with the columns in your tibble. 
At its most basic **select** allows you to make a vector from a specific variable
```{r}
select(tidy_counts_meta , counts)
```

---
## dplyr::select
**select** allows you to make a dataframe from several variables
```{r}
select(tidy_counts_meta, counts, ENTREZ)
```

---
## dplyr::select
**select** allows you to make a dataframe excluding a variable
```{r}
select(tidy_counts_meta, -Sample)
```

---
## dplyr::select
**select** allows you to make a dataframe from a range of variables
```{r}
select(tidy_counts_meta, CellType:SYMBOL)
```

---
## dplyr::filter
**filter** allows you to work with the rows in your tibble. 
Through __filter__ you can access observations based on criteria that produces a logical.
```{r}
filter(tidy_counts_meta, Sample == 'CD34_1')
```

---
## dplyr::filter
Here we use __filter__ to access observations based on several criteria.
```{r}
filter(tidy_counts_meta, Sample %in% c('CD34_1', 'ORTHO_1'))
```


---
## dplyr::filter
Similarly we can use __Filter__ to access observations based on numerical operators
```{r}
filter(tidy_counts_meta, counts > 0)
```


---
## dplyr::arrange
_Arrange_ sorts the dataframe based on a specific variable, in ascending order. 
```{r}
arrange(tidy_counts_meta, counts)
```

---
## dplyr::arrange
_Arrange_ can sort based on multiple variables using the order provided. We can also use the desc() function to change the order to descending.  
```{r}

arrange(tidy_counts_meta, CellType, desc(counts))
```

---
## dplyr::mutate
_Mutate_ creates a new column based on some form of computation. Here we are adding a z-score for the counts. 
```{r}
mutate(tidy_counts_meta, scale(counts))
```

---
## dplyr::mutate
_Mutate_  can be used to create a named variable in much the same way. 
```{r}
mutate(tidy_counts_meta, count_zscore = scale(counts))
```


---
## dplyr::summarize
_Summarize_ applies aggregating or summary function to a group i.e. counting. Lets see how many genes we have no counts for in each sample. First we will generate a table of genes with no counts. 

```{r}
filter(tidy_counts_meta, counts == 0)
```

---
## dplyr::summarize
Now we have some data to play with, we do the first key step in summarization: group_by. This adds the *Group* property. When we summarize it will be within these groups i.e. in this case its within Sample. 

```{r}
filter(tidy_counts_meta, counts == 0) %>%
  group_by(Sample) 
```

---
## dplyr::summarize
Once the tibble has group information we can then summarize over the these groups. We can use the *n()* function to count how many observations there are for each member of our group, Samples.

```{r}
filter(tidy_counts_expressed, counts == 0) %>%
  group_by(Sample) %>%
  summarise(n())
```

---
## dplyr::summarize
We can use _Summarize_ to apply more complex aggregating or summary functions i.e. mean. In this case we will calculate the mean gene counts across conditions. 
```{r}
tidy_counts_meta %>%
  group_by(ENTREZ) %>%
  summarise(counts_mean = mean(counts))
```

---
## dplyr::summarize
We can use also use multiple groups, for *group_by*. We can use this to generate a more useful mean; the mean counts in genes per CellType. 
```{r}
tidy_counts %>%
  group_by(ENTREZ, CellType) %>%
  summarise(counts_mean = mean(counts))
```

---
## dplyr::group_by
_Grouping_ can also be used to help filter within groups. Here we use order to get the genes with the top 3 amount of counts.
```{r}
tidy_counts_meta %>%
  group_by(Sample) %>%
  filter(order(counts, decreasing=T) <= 3)
```

---
## dplyr::group_by
We can stitch this together to do more complicated operations. In this case I am filtering to observations without 0 counts. I then am grouping by CellType and ENTREZ.
```{r}
tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  filter(counts != 0) %>% 
  group_by(CellType, ENTREZ)
```

---
## dplyr::group_by

Now that they are grouped by CellType and ENTREZ, we can filter for all genes that have counts greater than 0, in both replicates.
```{r}
tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  filter(counts != 0) %>% 
  group_by(CellType, ENTREZ) %>%  
  filter(n()>1)
```

---
## Piping and plots

By now it is clear how useful pipes can be, to stitch together the different operations. These pipes can go straight into plots. Here we make a simple X-Y plot to compare counts in our cell types. 

```{r}
p <- tidy_counts_meta %>%
  group_by(ENTREZ, CellType) %>%
  summarise(counts_mean = mean(counts)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=CellType, values_from=counts_mean) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=CD34, y=ORTHO)) + geom_point()

```

---
## Piping and plots

By now it is clear how useful pipes can be, to stitch together the different operations. These pipes can go straight into plots. Here we make a simple X-Y plot to compare counts in our cell types. 

```{r}
p 

```

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Outputting your tidy data
---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Readr again: Writing out 
You've made a lovely new tibble file. Now you need to save it somewhere. Theres a wide range of writing  options. Can specify the delmiter directly or use a specific function
```{r}

write_delim(tidy_counts_meta, '../counts_with_metadata.csv', delim =',')

write_csv(tidy_counts_meta, '../counts_with_metadata.csv')
```

A key difference compared to base is that it does not write out row names. Tibbles generally don't have rownames.

if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

  )
}else{
  cat("# Pattern matching with strings
---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## stringr

If the data you are working with involves characters from data entry often there will be errors i.e. clinical study metadata or a hand-typed list of genes of interest. Tidying data also means fixing these problems. stringr helps make this easy. 

* Access and manipulate characters
* Deal with whitespace
* Pattern Recognition

Though stringr is pretty comprehensive and covers most of what you will need, there is a sister package called stringi with even more functionality. 

---
## stringr::strsub
Many overlapping functions with base for combining, subsetting, converting and finding strings.

Extract substrings from a range. Here the 1st to 3rd character.
```{r}

brc <- c("Tom", "Ji-Dung", "Matthew", "Wei", "Doug")


brc %>% str_sub(1, 3)
```

Extract substrings from a range. Here the 2nd to 2nd to last character
```{r}
brc %>% str_sub(2, -2)
```

---
## stringr::strsub
Many overlapping functions with base for combining, subsetting, converting and finding strings.


Assign values back to substrings. Here the 2nd to 2nd to last character is replaced with X.
```{r}

str_sub(brc, 2, -2) <- 'X'
brc
```

---

## Replacing Strings
It is easy to replace specific strings with *str_replace_all*.
```{r}
str_replace_all(brc, 'Matthew', 'Matt')
str_replace_all(brc, 'u', 'z' )
```


---
## Stripping whitespace

Whitespace is often an issue for conssitent metadata. WE can use the *str_replace_all* function to remove whitespace. 
```{r}
brc2 <- c("Tom  ", "  Ji  -Dung", "Matt   ", "Wei", "D o u g")

str_replace_all(brc2, ' ','' )
```

Rather then replacing all whitespace, you can trim trailing and leading whitespace from strings. 

```{r}
str_trim(brc2)

```


Can add whitespace to strings to get consistent length. Here all are 10 characters
```{r}

str_pad(brc2, width=10, side='left')

## stringr::str\_to\_* - Capitalization
Often when manipulating strings we will also need to alter the capitalization. A common case is if we want to do a quick and easy conversion between gene symbol nomenclature. 
```{r}

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>%
  head()


tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>% 
  str_to_title() %>% 
  head()
```

---
## stringr::str\_to\_* - Capitalization 
String manipulation can be used with tibbles and mutate.

```{r}
tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  mutate(SYMBOL2 = str_to_title(SYMBOL))
```
---
## stringr::str\_to\_* - Capitalization
We can convert back to capitals, just as easy.
```{r}

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  mutate(SYMBOL2 = str_to_title(SYMBOL)) %>% 
  mutate(SYMBOL3 = str_to_upper(SYMBOL2))
```

## Finding patterns with stringr
 
Find patterns in different ways. *str_detect* gives a T/F whether the pattern 'GAP' is present in vector.
```{r}

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>% 
  str_detect('GAP') %>% head()

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>% 
  str_detect('GAP') %>%
  filter(tidy_counts_meta, .)
```

---
## Finding patterns with stringr

*str_subset* is similar to detect, but it returns the match itself.

```{r}

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>% 
  str_subset('GAP')

```

---
## Finding patterns with stringr

Count gives you the total number of times your pattern appears in each character in the vector.

```{r}

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>% 
  str_count('GAP') %>% .[1:100]

tidy_counts_meta %>% 
  pull(SYMBOL) %>% 
  str_count('A') %>% .[1:100]
```

## Tidy beyond this

Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) is the driving force behind the tidyverse. He is a good place to start at to get an idea of the future of tidy.   

Hadley wrote a paper about why he thinks tidy data is best: www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper.  

There is a lot of support for all things tidy at: https://www.tidyverse.org/  
(This includes really great cheat sheets for each tool)

## Tidy packages to check out:

lubridate and hms: Allow managing of calendar and time formats

broom: helps tidy up standard base function i.e. lm or t.test

tidymodels: A collection of tools for preparing for and validating model functions

plyranges: dplyr equivalent for working with ranges i.e. Granges
